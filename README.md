# Tic Tac Toe Game with React

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. This README provides an overview of the project structure and how to run the game on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

To run this Tic Tac Toe game, make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js: https://nodejs.org (version 14 or above)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the Tic Tac Toe game up and running:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code as a ZIP file.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Once the installation is complete, start the development server with the following command:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
5. The development server will start, and the game will be accessible in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `public/`: This directory contains the public assets for the game, such as the HTML template and the favicon.
- `src/`: This directory contains the application source code.
  - `components/`: This directory contains React components used in the game.
  - `App.js`: The main component representing the Tic Tac Toe game.
  - `index.js`: The entry point of the application.
  - `index.css`: Styling specific to the application.

## How to Play

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Two players take turns marking a cell with their respective symbol (X or O).
- The objective is to get three of your symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.

## Customization

If you want to customize the game or add new features, you can modify the source code in the `src/` directory. Here are a few ideas:

- Change the styling of the game board and the symbols.
- Add sound effects when a player makes a move or wins.
- Implement an AI opponent using various strategies.
- Keep track of and display statistics such as the number of wins for each player.

Feel free to explore and experiment with the code to make the game your own!

## Deploying the Game

To deploy the game to a live server, you can follow the deployment instructions provided by platforms such as Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages. Make sure to build the project before deploying using the command:
```
npm run build
```
This will generate an optimized production build of the game in the `build/` directory, ready for deployment.
